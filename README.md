# intro-to-c

Easily compile and run your `c` code/ program using:

```
gcc filename.c -o filename && ./filename
```

- the `switch` statement is an efficient replacement of consequent if statements. It can check a variable or a value, but **it can only check only one single value.** This means that, **it cannot check multiple character strings or arrays.**
