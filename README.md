# intro-to-c

Easily compile and run your `c` code/ program using:

```
gcc filename.c -o filename && ./filename
```

The `switch` statement is an efficient replacement of consequent if statements. It can check a variable or a value, but **it can only check only one single value.** This means that, **it cannot check multiple character strings or arrays.**

Normally, functions have to `return` something. If this is not possible, they should have the return type `void`. Void functions have no return statements. The return type is defined before the function name while the actual return statement, in the function's body

    ```
    void function happy() 
    {
        puts("A man is happy!);
    }
    ```
